# Pytorch 

This is a series of tutorials I wrote for implementing deep learning models with Pytorch. The goal of the series is to make Pytorch more intuitive and accessible as possible through examples of implementations. There are many tutorials on the Internet to use Pytorch to build many types of challenging models, but it can also be confusing at the same time because there are always slight differences when you pass from a tutorial to another. In this series, I want to start from the simplest topics to the more advanced ones.

## Deep Q Network with Pytorch

The task in this project is to train an agent on the **Acrobot** game. Pytorch will be used to implement the Deep Q network, while Google Colab notebook will be used since it provides free GPU to speed up the training.
