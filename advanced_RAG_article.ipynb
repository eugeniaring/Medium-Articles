            "Both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling began their careers at a young age, with Stone starting in theater productions as a child and Gosling starting in television as a teenager. Stone made her television debut in a reality show that produced only an unsold pilot, while Gosling had small television roles before transitioning to film. Stone appeared in well-received teen comedy films like Superbad, Zombieland, and Easy A, while Gosling had roles in various films before being cast in La La Land. Both actors drew from their own experiences as aspiring artists for their roles in the film, with Stone struggling to get auditions and Gosling experiencing a casting director taking a phone call during his emotional audition. Stone's love for musicals and dream of bursting into song influenced her performance in La La Land, while Gosling's decision to turn down a role in Beauty and the Beast in favor of La La Land showcases his commitment to challenging and diverse roles. Overall, both Stone and Gosling have had successful careers in the entertainment industry, with Stone winning multiple awards and Gosling establishing himself as a versatile actor.\n"
